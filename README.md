An Ultimate Explanation to know all about Format Specifiers in C

In C programming language, values can be type integer, floating-point, single character, or sequence of characters. We use format specifiers in C to display values of a variable of a different type. 

C contains different format specifiers used in printf() and scanf() functions; in this tutorial, we will go through a few important and most commonly used format specifiers in our C programs.

1.Why Do We Use C Format Specifiers?

Format specifiers in C are used to take inputs and print the output of a type. The symbol we use in every format specifier is %. Format specifiers tell the compiler about the type of data that must be given or input and the type of data that must be printed on the screen.
